<blockquote>
We consider the problem of finding for a given <em>N</em>-tuple of polynomials the closest <em>N</em>-tuple that has a common divisor of degree at least <em>d</em>. Extended weighted Euclidean semi-norm of coefficients is used as a measure of closeness. Two equivalent formulations of the problem are considered: (i) direct optimization over common divisors and cofactors, and (ii) Sylvester lowrank approximation. We use the duality between least-squares and least-norm problems to show that (i) and (ii) are closely related to mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. This allows us to apply recent results on complexity and accuracy of computations for mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. We develop optimization methods based on the variable projection principle. These methods have linear complexity in the degrees of the polynomials if either <em>d</em> is small or <em>d</em> is of the same order as the degrees of the polynomials. We provide a software implementation that is based on a software package for structured low-rank approximation.
