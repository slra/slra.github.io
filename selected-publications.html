<blockquote>
We consider low-rank approximation of affinely structured matrices with missing elements. The method proposed is based on reformulation of the problem as inner and outer optimization. The inner minimization is a singular linear least-norm problem and admits an analytic solution. The outer problem is a nonlinear least squares problem and is solved by local optimization methods: minimization subject to quadratic equality constraints and unconstrained minimization with regularized cost function. The method is generalized to weighted low-rank approximation with missing values and is illustrated on approximate low-rank matrix completion, system identification, and data-driven simulation problems. An extended version of the paper is a literate program, implementing the method and reproducing the presented results.

<blockquote>
Fitting data by a bounded complexity linear model is equivalent to low-rank approximation of a matrix constructed from the data. The data matrix being Hankel structured is equivalent to the existence of a linear time-invariant system that fits the data and the rank constraint is related to a bound on the model complexity. In the special case of fitting by a static model, the data matrix and its low-rank approximation are unstructured.<p>
We outline applications in system theory (approximate realization, model reduction, output error and errors-in-variables identification), signal processing (harmonic retrieval, sum-of-damped exponentials and finite impulse response modeling), and computer algebra (approximate common divisor). Algorithms based on heuristics and local optimization methods are presented. Generalizations of the low-rank approximation problem result from different approximation criteria (e.g., weighted norm) and constraints on the data matrix (e.g., nonnegativity). Related problems are rank minimization and structured pseudospectra.

<blockquote>
Classical linear time-invariant system simulation methods are based on a transfer function, impulse response, or input/state/output representation. We present a method for computing the response of a system to a given input and initial conditions directly from a trajectory of the system, without explicitly identifying the system from the data. Similarly to the classical approach for simulation, the classical approach for control is model-based: first a model representation is derived from given data of the plant and then a control law is synthesised using the model and the control specifications. We present an approach for computing a linear quadratic tracking control signal that circumvents the identification step. The results are derived assuming exact data and the simulated response or control input is constructed off-line.

<blockquote>
The following identification problem is considered: minimize the <em>l</em><sub>2</sub> norm of the difference between a given time series and an approximating one under the constraint that the approximating time series is a trajectory of a linear time invariant system of a fixed complexity. The complexity is measured by the input dimension and the maximum lag. The question leads to a problem that is known as the global total least squares problem and alternatively can be viewed as maximum likelihood identification in the errors-in-variables setup. Multiple time series and latent variables can be considered in the same setting. Special cases of the problem are autonomous system identification, approximate realization, and finite time optimal <em>l</em><sub>2</sub> model reduction. <p>
The identification problem is related to the structured total least squares problem. The paper presents an efficient software package that implements the theory. The proposed method and software are tested on data sets from the database for the identification of systems DAISY.

<blockquote>
The monograph is an outgrow of the first author's PhD thesis. Linear, bilinear, and quadratic static models as well as linear dynamic models are considered. Exact subspace-type and approximate optimization-based identification methods are presented in a representation-free setting. The theme of the book, unifying the wide range of applications and solution methods, is the behavioral approach to mathematical modeling, an approach that requires models to be viewed as sets of possible outcomes rather than to be a priori bound to particular representations.
