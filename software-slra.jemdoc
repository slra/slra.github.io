= SLRA: Software for weighted structured low-rank approximation
~~~

== Overview

SLRA is a C++ software with interface to MATLAB, Octave, and R for solving low-rank approximation problems
\(
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over} \ \widehat p \quad \|p - \widehat p\|_w \quad \text{subject to} \quad \text{rank}({\cal S}(\widehat p)) \leq r,
\)
with the following features:
- [examples.html mosaic Hankel structured] approximating matrix ${\cal S}(\widehat p)$,
- weighted 2-norm approximation criterion 
\(
\|p\|_w = \textstyle\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n_p} w_i p_i^2},
\)
- fixed elements in the approximating matrix,
- missing elements in the data matrix,
- linear constraints on an approximating matrix's left kernel basis.

For an $m\times n$ matrix ${\cal S}(\widehat p)$, with $m < n$, the computational complexity of the cost function and derivative evaluation is $O(m^2n)$, so that the package is suitable for applications with $n\gg m$. Problems with $n_p \leq n(m - r)$ can not be solved by the method, used in the software.

== Usage

In MATLAB/Octave, once the structure and approximation criterion are specified in a variable +s+ (see [examples.html examples] and the [https://github.com/slra/slra/raw/master/slra.pdf manual]), the problem is solved by a call of the +slra+ function: 
~~~
{}{}
[ph, info] = slra(p, s, r, opt);
~~~
- The optional parameter +opt+ is used to specify an initial approximation and options for the optimization method. 
- The output parameter +info+ contains information about the convergence of the optimization method. # In particular, +info.Rh+ is a low-rank certificate: $\widehat R {\cal S}(\widehat p) = 0$.

=== System identification 

A major application area of mosaic Hankel structured low-rank approximation methods is system identification. The +slra+ package includes a wrapper function +ident+ for identification of linear time-invariant systems. For details see the [software-ident.html ident package].
