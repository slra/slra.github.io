A direct solution to this problem is given in [Linear Algebra and Its Applications, Vol.\ 433, pp.~1719--1721]. An alternative direct solution that reduces the problem to a generalized eigenvalue problem is derived in this paper.

  abstract = {Rank deficiency of a data matrix is equivalent to the existence of an exact linear model for the data. For the purpose of linear static modeling, the matrix is unstructured and the corresponding modeling problem is an approximation of the matrix by another matrix of a lower rank. In the context of linear time-invariant dynamic models, the appropriate data matrix is Hankel and the corresponding modeling problems becomes structured low-rank approximation. Low-rank approximation has applications in: system identification; signal processing, machine learning, and computer algebra, where different types of structure and constraints occur. This paper gives an overview of recent progress in efficient local optimization algorithms for solving weighted mosaic-Hankel structured low-rank approximation problems. In addition, the data matrix may have missing elements and elements may be specified as exact. The described algorithms are implemented in a publicly available software package. Their application to system identification, approximate common divisor, and data-driven simulation problems is described in this paper and is illustrated by reproducible simulation examples. As a data modeling paradigm the low-rank approximation setting is closely related to the the behavioral approach in systems and control, total least squares, errors-in-variables modeling, principal component analysis, and rank minimization.},

  abstract = {Subsampling of a linear periodically time-varying system results in a collection of linear time-invariant systems with common poles. This key fact, known as ``lifting'', is used in a two step realization method. The first step is the realization of the time-invariant dynamics (the lifted system). Computationally, this step is a rank-revealing factorization of a block-Hankel matrix. The second step derives a state space representation of the periodic time-varying system. It is shown that no extra computations are required in the second step. The computational complexity of the overall method is therefore equal to the complexity for the realization of the lifted system. A modification of the realization method is proposed, which makes the complexity independent of the parameter variation period. Replacing the rank-revealing factorization in the realization algorithm by structured low-rank approximation yields a maximum likelihood identification method. Existing methods for structured low-rank approximation are used to identify efficiently linear periodically time-varying system. These methods can deal with missing data.

This problem occurs in system identification, signal processing and computer algebra, among others. We impose the low-rank by modeling the approximation as a product of two factors with reduced dimension. The structure of the low-rank model is enforced by introducing a regularization term in the objective function. The proposed local optimization algorithm is able to solve the weighted structured low-rank approximation problem, as well as to deal with the cases of missing or fixed elements. In contrast to approaches based on kernel representations (in linear algebraic sense), the proposed algorithm is designed to address the case of small targeted rank. We compare it to existing approaches on numerical examples of system identification, approximate greatest common divisor problem, and symmetric tensor decomposition and demonstrate its consistently good performance.},

  abstract = {The notion of the most powerful unfalsified model plays a key role in system identification. Since its introduction in the mid 80's, many methods have been developed for its numerical computation. All currently existing methods, however, assume that the given data is a /complete/ trajectory of the system. Motivated by the practical issues of data corruption due to failing sensors, transmission lines, or storage devices, we study the problem of computing the most powerful unfalsified model from data with missing values. We do not make assumptions about the nature or pattern of the missing values apart from the basic one that they are a part of a trajectory of a linear time-invariant system. The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The method proposed constructs rank deficient complete submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix. Under specified conditions the kernels of the submatrices form a nonminimal kernel representation of the data generating system. The final step of the algorithm is reduction of the nonminimal kernel representation to a minimal one. Apart from its practical relevance in identification, missing data is a useful concept in systems and control. Classic problems, such as simulation, filtering, and tracking control can be viewed as missing data estimation problems for a given system. The corresponding identification problems with missing data are ``data-driven'' equivalents of the classical simulation, filtering, and tracking control problems.},

We propose an algorithm based on Jacobi rotations, for which symmetry is preserved at each iteration. Two numerical examples are provided indicating the need of such algorithms. An important part of the paper consists of proving that our algorithm converges to stationary points of the objective function. This can be considered an advantage of the proposed algorithm over existing symmetry-preserving algorithms in the literature.}

  abstract = {Matrix factorization has been widely utilized as a latent factor model for solving the recommender system problem using collaborative filtering. For a recommender system, all the ratings in the rating matrix are bounded within a pre-determined range. In this paper, we propose a new improved matrix factorization approach for such a rating matrix, called Bounded Matrix Factorization (BMF), which imposes a lower and an upper bound on every estimated missing element of the rating matrix. We present an efficient algorithm to solve BMF based on the block coordinate descent method. We show that our algorithm is scalable for large matrices with missing elements on multicore systems with low memory. We present substantial experimental results illustrating that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art algorithms for recommender system such as stochastic gradient descent, alternating least squares with regularization, SVD++ and Bias-SVD on real-world datasets such as Jester, Movielens, Book crossing, Online dating and Netflix.}

  abstract = {Implementation of multivariate and 2D extensions of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) by means of the R package Rssa is considered. The extensions include MSSA for simultaneous analysis and forecasting of several time series and 2D-SSA for analysis of digital images. A new extension of 2D-SSA analysis called shaped 2D-SSA is introduced for analysis of images of arbitrary shape, not necessary rectangular. It is shown that implementation of shaped 2D-SSA can serve as a basis for implementation of MSSA and other generalizations. Efficient implementation of operations with Hankel and Hankel-block-Hankel matrices through the fast Fourier transform is suggested. Examples with code fragments in R, which explain the methodology and demonstrate the proper use of Rssa, are presented.},
