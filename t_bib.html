  abstract = {We consider the problem of finding for a given $N$-tuple of polynomials the closest $N$-tuple that has a common divisor of degree at least $d$. Extended weighted Euclidean semi-norm of coefficients is used as a measure of closeness. Two equivalent formulations of the problem are considered: (i) direct optimization over common divisors and cofactors, and (ii) Sylvester lowrank approximation. We use the duality between least-squares and least-norm problems to show that (i) and (ii) are closely related to mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. This allows us to apply recent results on complexity and accuracy of computations for mosaic Hankel low-rank approximation. We develop optimization methods based on the variable projection principle. These methods have linear complexity in the degrees of the polynomials if either $d$ is small or $d$ is of the same order as the degrees of the polynomials. We provide a software implementation that is based on a software package for structured low-rank approximation.}

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of computing the distance from a given linear time-invariant system to the nearest uncontrollable system is posed and solved in the behavioral setting. In the case of a system with two external variables, the problem is restated as a Sylvester structured distance to singularity problem. The structured distance to singularity problem is then solved by integrating a system of ordinary differential equations which describes the gradient associated to the cost functional.
An advantage of the method with respect to other approaches is in its capability to include further constraints. Numerical simulations also show that the method is more robust to the initial approximation than the Newton-type methods.},

Subsequently, local optimization, subspace, and convex relaxation methods can be used for the numerical solution. In this paper, we show another approach, based on the recently proposed concept of structured data fusion. Structured data fusion problems are solved in the Tensorlab toolbox by local optimization methods. The approach allows fitting of signals with missing samples and adding constraints on the model, such as fixed exponents and common dynamics in multi-channel estimation problems. These problems are non-trivial to solve by other existing methods.},

  abstract = {The notion of the most powerful unfalsified model plays a key role in system identification. Since its introduction in the mid 80's, many methods have been developed for its numerical computation. All currently existing methods, however, assume that the given data is a /complete/ trajectory of the system. Motivated by the practical issues of data corruption due to failing sensors, transmission lines, or storage devices, we study the problem of computing the most powerful unfalsified model from data with missing values. We do not make assumptions about the nature or pattern of the missing values apart from the basic one that they are a part of a trajectory of a linear time-invariant system. The identification problem with missing data is equivalent to a Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion problem. The method proposed constructs rank deficient complete submatrices of the incomplete Hankel matrix. Under specified conditions the kernels of the submatrices form a nonminimal kernel representation of the data generating system. The final step of the algorithm is reduction of the nonminimal kernel representation to a minimal one. Apart from its practical relevance in identification, missing data is a useful concept in systems and control. Classic problems, such as simulation, filtering, and tracking control can be viewed as missing data estimation problems for a given system. The corresponding identification problems with missing data are ``data-driven'' equivalents of the classical simulation, filtering, and tracking control problems.},

  abstract = {In signal processing as well as in control and other mathematical engineering areas, it is common to use a model-based approach, which splits the problem into two steps: 1) model identification and 2) model-based design. Despite its success the model-based approach has the shortcoming that the design objective is not taken into account at the identification step, \ie, the model is not optimized for its intended use. In this paper, we propose an approach for data processing, called data-driven signal processing, that combines the identification and the model-based design into one joint problem. The to-be-computed signal is modeled as a missing part of a trajectory of the (unknown) data generating system. Subsequently, the missing data estimation problem is reformulated as a mosaic-Hankel structured matrix low-rank approximation and completion problem. A local optimization methods, based on the variable projections principle, is used for the numerical solution of the matrix completion/approximation problem. The missing data estimation approach for data-driven signal processing and the local optimization method for its implementation in practice are illustrated on examples of state estimation, filtering/smoothing, and prediction. Development of fast algorithms with provable properties in the presence of measurement noise and disturbances will make the matrix completion approach for data-driven signal processing a practically feasible alternative to the model-based methods.},
